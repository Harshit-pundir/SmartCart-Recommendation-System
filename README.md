# SmartCart Recommendation System 🛒

SmartCart is a mini machine learning project focused on understanding data preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and basic recommendation system concepts using Python.

This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow starting from data exploration to
feature engineering and recommendation logic.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
To build a smart cart system that analyzes product-related data and generates
basic product recommendations by applying data preprocessing and machine learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Approach
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading and exploration
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Handling categorical features using **OneHotEncoder**
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Dimensionality reduction using **PCA**
- Logic-based product recommendation

---

## 🔧 Machine Learning Concepts Used
- OneHot Encoding (Categorical Data Handling)
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Data Visualization
- Recommendation Logic

---

## ✅ Result
The system successfully preprocesses the data, reduces feature dimensionality,
and generates meaningful product recommendations, showcasing the fundamentals
of a smart recommendation system.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Collaborative filtering based recommendations
- Content-based filtering
- Model-based recommendation systems
- Web application deployment using Streamlit or Flask

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
